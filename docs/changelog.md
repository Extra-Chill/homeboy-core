## 0.2.0

### Improvements
- **Config schema**: Introduce `homeboy config` command group + `ConfigKeys` schema listing to standardize how config keys are described/exposed.
- **Config records**: Standardize config identity via `slugify_id()` + `SlugIdentifiable::slug_id()` and enforce id/name consistency in `ConfigManager::save_server()` and `ConfigManager::save_component()`.
- **App config**: Extend `AppConfig` with `installedModules: HashMap<String, InstalledModuleConfig>`; each extension stores `settings: HashMap<String, Value>` and optional `sourceUrl` (stored in the extension manifest).
- **Extension scoping**: Add `ExtensionScope::{effective_settings, validate_project_compatibility, resolve_component_scope}` to merge settings across app/project/component and validate `ExtensionManifest.requires` (for example: `components`).
- **Extension execution**: Tighten `homeboy extension run` to require an installed/configured entry and resolve project/component context when CLI templates reference project variables.
- **Command context**: Refactor SSH/base-path resolution to shared context helpers (used by `db`/`deploy`) for more consistent configuration errors.
- **Docs**: Normalize docs placeholders (`<project_id>`, `<server_id>`, `<component_id>`) across embedded CLI documentation.

## 0.1.13

### Improvements
- **Changelog**: `homeboy changelog add` auto-detects changelog path when `changelogTargets` is not configured.
- **Changelog**: Default next section label is `Unreleased` (aliases include `[Unreleased]`).
- **Version**: `homeboy version bump` finalizes the "next" section into the new version section whenever `--changelog-add` is used.

## 0.1.12

### Improvements
- **Changelog**: Promote `homeboy changelog` from a shortcut to a subcommand group with `show` and `add`.
- **Changelog**: Add `homeboy changelog add <component_id> <message>` to append items to the “next” section (defaults to `Unreleased`).
- **Changelog**: Auto-detect changelog path (`CHANGELOG.md` or `docs/changelog.md`) when `changelogTargets` is not configured.
- **Config**: Support `changelogTargets` + `changelogNextSectionLabel`/`changelogNextSectionAliases` at component/project/app levels.
- **Version**: Write JSON version bumps via the `version` key (pretty-printed) when using the default JSON version pattern.
- **Deploy**: Load components via `ConfigManager` instead of ad-hoc JSON parsing.

## 0.1.11

- **Docs/Positioning**: Updated README and docs index to reflect LLM-first focus and Homeboy data directory layout.

## 0.1.9

### Improvements
- **Project management**: Added `homeboy project list` and `homeboy project pin` subcommands to manage pinned files/logs per project.
- **Config correctness**: Project configs are a strict `ProjectRecord` (`id` derived via `slugify_id(name)`) with validation to prevent mismatched IDs and to clear `active_project_id` when a project is deleted.
- **Docs**: Updated embedded docs to reflect new/removed commands.

## 0.1.8

### Improvements
- **Versioning**: `versionTargets` are now first-class for component version management (supports multiple files and multiple matches per file, with strict validation).
- **Deploy**: Reads the component version from `versionTargets[0]` for local/remote comparisons.

## 0.1.7

### Improvements
- **Component configuration**: Support `versionTargets` (multiple version targets) and optional `buildCommand` in component config.
- **Version bumping**: `homeboy version bump` validates that all matches in each target are the same version before replacing.
- **Deploy JSON output**: Deploy results include `artifactPath`, `remotePath`, `buildCommand`, `buildExitCode`, and an upload exit code for clearer automation.
- **Docs refresh**: Updated command docs + JSON output contract; removed outdated command/contract doc.

## 0.1.6

### New Features
- **Embedded docs**: Embed `homeboy/docs/**/*.md` into the CLI binary at build time, so `homeboy docs` works in Homebrew/releases.
- **Docs source of truth**: Keep CLI documentation under `docs/` and embed it into the CLI binary.

- **Docs topic listing**: `available_topics` is now generated dynamically from embedded keys (newline-separated).

## 0.1.5

### Breaking Changes
- **Docs Command Output**: `homeboy docs` now prints embedded markdown to stdout by default (instead of paging).

### New Features

- **Core Shell Utilities**: Added `homeboy_core::shell::cd_and()` to build safe "cd && <cmd>" strings.
- **Core Token Utilities**: Added `homeboy_core::token` helpers for case-insensitive identifiers and doc topic normalization.

### Improvements

## 0.1.4

### New Features
