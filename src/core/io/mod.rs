//! Shared low-level IO helpers used across core subsystems.
//!
//! These helpers exist to consolidate genuinely duplicated workflows (recursive
//! directory copy, etc.) so callers can reuse a single implementation while
//! keeping their own error-context labels. Single-file IO (e.g. observation
//! artifact persistence) lives with its caller — these helpers are only for
//! workflows that recurse or loop in the same shape.
