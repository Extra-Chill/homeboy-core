# Homeboy CLI

CLI for project development and deployment. Provides terminal access to project management, remote CLI operations (WP-CLI, PM2), database queries, deployments, and component-scoped git operations.

**CLI documentation**: run `homeboy docs` (and `homeboy docs <topic>`).

## Commands Overview

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `projects` | List configured projects |
| `project` | Manage project configurations (create, show, set, delete, switch, subtarget, component) |
| `component` | Manage standalone component configurations |
| `server` | Manage server configurations (create, show, set, delete, list) |
| `git` | Component-scoped git operations (status, commit, push, pull, tag) |
| `wp` | Execute WP-CLI commands on remote WordPress servers |
| `pm2` | Execute PM2 commands on remote Node.js servers |
| `db` | Database operations - read-only (tables, describe, query) |
| `deploy` | Deploy components to production |
| `ssh` | Execute SSH commands or open interactive shell |
| `module` | Manage and run Homeboy modules |

## Quick Start

```bash
homeboy projects                    # List all projects
homeboy projects --current          # Get active project ID
homeboy help <command>              # Get detailed help for any command
```

## Safety Guidelines

1. **Deploy**: Always run with `--dry-run` first to preview changes
2. **Database**: All `db` queries are read-only by design. For write operations, use `homeboy wp <project> db query`
3. **SSH**: Exercise caution with destructive commands on production servers
4. **PM2**: `restart` affects live services - confirm intent before executing

## Common Patterns

### Remote WordPress Operations
```bash
homeboy wp <project> plugin list
homeboy wp <project> cache flush
homeboy wp <project> core version
```

### Database Queries (Read-Only)
```bash
homeboy db tables <project>
homeboy db describe <project> <table>
homeboy db query <project> "SELECT * FROM wp_options LIMIT 10"
```

### Deployment
```bash
homeboy deploy <project> --dry-run --all    # Preview all deployments
homeboy deploy <project> --outdated         # Deploy changed components only
homeboy deploy <project> <component-id>     # Deploy specific component
```

### Git Operations (Component-Scoped)
No more `cd` to directories - operate on components by name:
```bash
homeboy git status <component>              # Show git status
homeboy git commit <component> "message"    # Stage all and commit
homeboy git push <component>                # Push to remote
homeboy git push <component> --tags         # Push with tags
homeboy git pull <component>                # Pull from remote
homeboy git tag <component> v1.0.0          # Create lightweight tag
homeboy git tag <component> v1.0.0 -m "msg" # Create annotated tag
```

### Release Workflow (Dogfooding)
```bash
homeboy git commit <component> "Release v1.0.0"
homeboy git tag <component> v1.0.0
homeboy git push <component> --tags         # Triggers CI/CD
```

### Subtargets (Multisite/Multi-environment)
Commands accepting `[subtarget]` can target specific blogs or environments:
```bash
homeboy wp <project> <subtarget> plugin list
homeboy db query <project> <subtarget> "SELECT ..."
```

Refer to the full CLI documentation for complete command reference and configuration details.
