This directory contains instructions for AI agents when using Homeboy. These can be implemented as either commands or skills, depending on your preferences and the provider you use. 

It is helpful to provide structured workflows for Homeboy CLI commands. Over time, we are hoping to perfect the way that Homeboy handles teaching agents how to use it. 

Using these custom commands may become redundant. But they are provided as a convenience, and for our developers to experiment with the CLI without having to type repetitive instructions.
