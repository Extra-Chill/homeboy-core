# Homeboy

Development automation infrastructure for software projects.

## What It Does

Homeboy turns a repo, project, or fleet into a component-aware automation surface: local development, CI, releases, dev rigs, stacks, benchmarks, dependency maintenance, triage, and ops all run through one CLI.

- **Component-aware quality gates** — Audit, lint, test, review, and refactor code with the same commands locally and in CI.
- **Release automation** — Plan versions, changelogs, tags, and publish steps from commit history.
- **Local development rigs** — Materialize reproducible multi-component environments and combined-fixes branches.
- **Performance benchmarks** — Run benchmark scenarios with baselines, ratchets, regression gates, and rig-scoped comparisons.
- **Dependency and attention loops** — Surface dependency drift, failing checks, open issues, and structured review artifacts.
- **Fleet operations** — Deploy components, inspect servers, query databases, read files, tail logs, and transfer artifacts.
- **Agent-ready output** — Write stable JSON artifacts for automation and AI agents without scraping terminal logs.

## Architecture

One component model, several execution contexts:

### Command Families

| Family | Commands | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Quality** | `audit`, `lint`, `test`, `review`, `refactor` | Keep codebases healthy and reviewable. |
| **Release** | `release`, `version`, `changelog`, `changes` | Turn commit history into versions, tags, and release notes. |
| **Dev substrate** | `rig`, `stack` | Recreate local environments and maintain combined-fixes branches. |
| **Performance** | `bench` | Track benchmark scenarios against baselines and environments. |
| **Attention** | `deps`, `triage`, `status`, `issues`, `report` | Find dependency drift, failing work, and review artifacts. |
| **Ops** | `deploy`, `ssh`, `file`, `db`, `logs`, `transfer` | Operate projects and fleets from the same component graph. |
| **Platforms** | `wp`, `cargo`, `extension` | Route platform-specific behavior through extensions. |

For exhaustive command docs, see [docs/commands/commands-index.md](docs/commands/commands-index.md) or run `homeboy docs list`.

## Quick Start

### 1. Add `homeboy.json`

Put a portable component config at the repo root:

```json
{
  "id": "my-project",
  "extensions": {
    "rust": {}
  }
}
```

Use the extension that matches the repo. For example, Rust projects can use `rust`, and WordPress projects can use `wordpress`.

### 2. Run local quality gates

Start locally before wiring CI:

```bash
homeboy audit
homeboy lint
homeboy test
homeboy review
```

The same commands can also target a component explicitly or use a checkout path:

```bash
homeboy review my-project --changed-since origin/main
homeboy lint my-project --path /path/to/worktree
```

### 3. Add CI when the local loop is useful

`Extra-Chill/homeboy-action@v2` installs Homeboy in GitHub Actions, sets up extensions, runs commands, posts PR comments, and can apply safe autofixes.

```yaml
name: Homeboy
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: Extra-Chill/homeboy-action@v2
        with:
          extension: rust
          commands: audit,lint,test,review
```

Release automation can be manual, scheduled, or CI-driven. Use the same action when you want release jobs to run in GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Release
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: Extra-Chill/homeboy-action@v2
        with:
          extension: rust
          component: my-project
          commands: release
```

## Core Workflows

### Code Quality And Review

`homeboy audit` detects convention drift, duplication, dead code, test coverage gaps, stale docs, and structural risk. Baselines let existing debt stay visible while preventing new regressions.

`homeboy lint` delegates formatting and static analysis to the configured extension. `homeboy test` runs the component's test suite. `homeboy review` is the PR-shaped umbrella that runs scoped audit, lint, and test checks and can render a PR-comment report.

```bash
homeboy audit --changed-since origin/main
homeboy lint --changed-only
homeboy test
homeboy review --changed-since origin/main --report pr-comment
```

`homeboy refactor` handles structural mechanical edits such as naming changes. Safe rewrites can be applied automatically; higher-risk plans stay explicit.

### Release And Changelog

Homeboy's release path is driven by conventional commits:

- `fix:` commits produce patch releases.
- `feat:` commits produce minor releases.
- `BREAKING CHANGE` produces major releases.
- `docs:`, `test:`, `ci:`, and `chore:` commits do not require a release by default.

The release family keeps version targets, changelogs, tags, and release artifacts tied to the same plan:

```bash
homeboy changes
homeboy version
homeboy changelog
homeboy release
```

### Local Dev Rigs And Stacks

`homeboy rig` manages reproducible local environments: components, background services, symlinks, checks, git operations, builds, and patch steps. A rig can bring up a multi-repo setup, check its health, sync stacks, and tear it down.

```bash
homeboy rig install https://github.com/your-org/rigs.git//packages/app
homeboy rig up app
homeboy rig check app
homeboy rig sync app
homeboy rig down app
```

`homeboy stack` manages combined-fixes branches built from a base branch plus declared PRs. It can inspect, apply, rebase, sync, diff, and push the target branch.

```bash
homeboy stack status app-combined
homeboy stack sync app-combined
homeboy stack push app-combined
```

### Benchmarks

`homeboy bench` makes benchmarks a first-class quality gate. Extensions provide the benchmark runner; Homeboy owns baseline storage, regression policies, ratchets, and rig-scoped comparisons.

```bash
homeboy bench my-project --baseline
homeboy bench my-project --ratchet
homeboy bench my-project --rig app
```

### Dependencies And Attention

`homeboy deps` inspects and updates component dependencies. `homeboy triage` gathers read-only attention reports across components, projects, fleets, rigs, or the whole workspace.

```bash
homeboy deps status my-project
homeboy deps update vendor/package my-project --to '^1.2'
homeboy status my-project
homeboy triage workspace --mine --failing-checks
```

`homeboy issues` reconciles findings against an issue tracker, and `homeboy report` renders structured output artifacts such as review results.

### Fleet And Ops

Homeboy models deployed work as components attached to projects, projects attached to servers, and projects grouped into fleets.

```text
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ component   │────>│ project     │────>│ server      │
│ plugin/CLI  │     │ site/app    │     │ VPS/host    │
└─────────────┘     └──────┬──────┘     └─────────────┘
                           │
                           v
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │ fleet       │
                    │ group       │
                    └─────────────┘
```

That model backs ops commands:

```bash
homeboy deploy my-project
homeboy ssh production
homeboy logs production
homeboy db query production "select 1"
homeboy file read production /path/to/file
homeboy transfer production staging /path/to/file
```

## Command Surface Map

This is a map, not a generated reference. Use `homeboy <command> --help` or [docs/commands/commands-index.md](docs/commands/commands-index.md) for exact options.

| Area | Commands |
|------|----------|
| Code quality / review | `audit`, `lint`, `test`, `review`, `refactor`, `build`, `validate` |
| Release / changelog | `release`, `version`, `changelog`, `changes` |
| Local dev environments | `rig`, `stack` |
| Benchmarks | `bench` |
| Dependencies / attention | `deps`, `triage`, `status`, `issues`, `report` |
| Fleet / ops | `deploy`, `ssh`, `file`, `db`, `logs`, `transfer`, `server`, `project`, `component`, `fleet` |
| Extensions / platform verbs | `extension`, `wp`, `cargo` |
| Meta | `config`, `docs`, `daemon`, `self`, `undo`, `auth`, `api`, `upgrade`, `list` |

## JSON Output Contract

Most Homeboy commands can write machine-readable output with `--output <path>` while still printing human output to stdout.

```bash
homeboy review --changed-since origin/main --output homeboy-ci-results/review.json
homeboy bench my-project --output homeboy-ci-results/bench.json
homeboy triage workspace --output homeboy-ci-results/triage.json
```

The output file contains command-specific JSON only, without log text. That makes Homeboy suitable for CI jobs, scheduled automation, and AI agents that need stable artifacts instead of terminal scraping.

## Extensions

Extensions add platform-specific behavior while keeping the Homeboy command model consistent.

| Extension | What it provides |
|-----------|------------------|
| `rust` | Cargo integration, Rust build/test/lint/release behavior, and crates.io artifacts. |
| `wordpress` | WP-CLI integration, WordPress-aware build/test/lint/release behavior. |
| `nodejs` | Node/PM2 process management. |
| `github` | GitHub release and issue/PR integration. |
| `homebrew` | Homebrew tap publishing. |
| `swift` | Swift testing for macOS/iOS projects. |

```bash
homeboy extension install https://github.com/Extra-Chill/homeboy-extensions --id rust
homeboy extension list
```

Installed extensions can expose their own top-level verbs, such as `homeboy wp` and `homeboy cargo`.

## Configuration

Global config lives in `~/.config/homeboy/`. Portable component config lives in `homeboy.json` at the repository root.

```text
~/.config/homeboy/
├── homeboy.json       # global defaults
├── components/        # registered component definitions
├── projects/          # project definitions and server bindings
├── servers/           # server connections
├── fleets/            # project groups
├── rigs/              # local dev rig specs
├── stacks/            # stack specs
├── extensions/        # installed extensions
└── keys/              # SSH keys
```

The portable repo-level `homeboy.json` is enough for local commands and CI. Global component/project/server/fleet config is for reusable local and ops workflows.
